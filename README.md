## Updates
- **0.1** (October 5th, 18:04) :: Finished the `data`, `entry` and `tree` modules, all of which pass all the tests supplied by the teachers

## Building and using
Integrate this library into your own project if you want and write your own makefile, but if you're a **FCUL Distributed Systems teacher evaluating this** (you sneaky little man), just drop your source `test-*.c` files into the included source folder, then, from the project's root directory use:
```
$ make
```
to build all the tests. After that, you'll find all of the test binaries in the `binary` directory.

If you wish to build only a specific test, specify which one (without the `.c` extension):
```
$ make test_tree
```
